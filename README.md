# FBI-gun-data_project

This is the README file for the FBI Gun Data Analysis project from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. 

The project includes data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) as well as state level data from the US Census. Anytime an individual wants to purchase a firearm or explosive, a background check is entered into the NICS system to ensure that the individual is an eligible buyer.
In this project, I combine these two data sources to look at the relationship between gun background checks and population data from the time period 2010 and 2016.  Gun statistics identified pertain to the overall trend of gun purchases and states with the highest volume and per capita gun registrations.

Project Materials:

The NICS data is found in the .xlsx file and contains the number of firearm checks by month, state, and type. 

The U.S. census data is found in the csv data with state-level demographic data. Most variables per state contain only data for 2016, but some cover more than one year.

Investigate_Guns_Dataset.ipynb is found in the main FBI_Guns_Data folder. This notebook is used to run the analysis.
